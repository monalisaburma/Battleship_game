# Battleship Game

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Battleship, created using Python and the Tkinter library. The game features a 9x9 grid where players can attempt to sink hidden ships by selecting grid coordinates.

## Features
- A 9x9 game board grid.
- Four types of ships: Battleship, Cruiser, Destroyer, and Submarine.
- Randomized ship placement at the start of the game.
- Simple GUI for interaction and gameplay.
- Visual feedback for hits and misses.

## Prerequisites
Before running this game, you need to have Python installed on your system. Python 3.x is recommended. You can download Python here.

## Installation
### To play the game, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/battleship-game.git
```

### Navigate to the cloned repository's directory:
```bash
cd battleship-game
```

### Run the game using Python:

python battleship.py
```

## How to Play
- The game starts with the ships placed randomly on the grid.
- Click on a grid cell to attack. If a ship is present, it will turn red; otherwise, the cell will turn blue.
- Continue attacking until all ships are sunk.
- The game ends when all ships are sunk, and a victory message is displayed.
